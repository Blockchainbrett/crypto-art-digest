### Crypto Art Bidding Wars Will Change Art History 

You might be familiar with the art auctions like the famous banksy auctioned at Sotheby’s that had known art collectors and brokers in one room, but have you heard about the CryptoArt bidding wars? These bidding wars are open to anyone, happen online, and with all sorts of auction formats. “Whales” or big spenders have elevated the value of  the crypto art industry taking crypto artist from last year selling a 1 of 1 art piece for $100, to now selling new pieces for $10,000+ and some being listed on secondary markets for $50k - $150 k. The platforms make the piece of art a token on the blockchain that can be sold over any platform and the royalties for the artist and the platform are baked into the token for any secondary sales.

##### History of legendary bidding wars
* A Cryptokitty sold for ($140,000)[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/cryptokitty-auction.html] on May, 2018 while in person was won with an online bid. Mike Novogratz, founder of hedge fund Galaxy Digital, participated and was quoted saying, “In 10 years, I think it’s going to be worth millions.”
* The “Homer Pepe” from the Rare Pepe collection was auctioned during the Rare Art Festival in January, 2018 in person but paid for with $40,000 worth of Pepe cash
